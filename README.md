## Methodology

### 1. Hardware Components
- **Voltage Measurement**:
  - Potential transformer (250/12V) measures line voltage.
  - Signal conditioning ensures compatibility with ESP32.
- **Current Measurement**:
  - Current transformer (5A rating) measures load current.
  - Signal conditioning converts analog signals to compatible pulses.
- **Power Factor Calculation**:
  - Operational amplifier generates pulsating signals to calculate power factor.
- **Circuit Design**:
  - Power supply circuit supports multiple voltage levels (3.3V, 5V, 12V).
  - OLED display visualizes real-time power and billing data.

### 2. IoT and Database Integration
- **Cloud Database**:
  - Utilizes Firebase for seamless communication between the smart meter and the Android application.
- **Unit Measurement**:
  - Optocoupler detects LED pulses from the energy meter.
  - Arduino calculates consumed and credited units based on the entered amount.

### 3. Android Application
- Developed using Kodular Creator, the app provides:
  - Secure login with biometric authentication.
  - Real-time monitoring of power consumption and billing status.
  - Load control options for home automation.

### 4. Peak Load Management
- Automatically disconnects power loads during predefined peak hours.
- Light loads remain connected to reduce the strain on UPS batteries and grid infrastructure.
- Alerts for unauthorized load bypassing with theft detection mechanisms.
